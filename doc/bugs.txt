GENERAL
-------

- generate-ttl.sh expects hardcoded directory bin/


LINUX
-----

- LXDRAGDROPBUG : Drag and drop not working on both WKGTK and CEF web views.

- WKGTKRESIZEBUG : Broken CSS viewport units (vw/vh/vmin/vmax) in WebKitGTK 
  web view due to workaround for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229227

- CEFKBDFOCUSBUG : Toggling keyboard focus works for the CEF based web view but
  Xlib errors are generated when calling setKeyboardFocus(true). XIGrabDevice()
  is probably called with incorrect arguments, see CefHelper.cpp.


WINDOWS
-------

- WINWASMERBUG : WASM plugins crash on Carla and Live when running the Wasmer
  runtime (no issues on WAMR). Work as expected on REAPER, Renoise and Ardour 7.
