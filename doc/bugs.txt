GENERAL
-------

- generate-ttl.sh expects hardcoded directory bin/


LINUX
-----

- WKGTKRESIZEBUG : broken CSS viewport units (vw/vh/vmin/vmax) in WebKitGTK 
  web view due to workaround for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229227
- DSSI plugin builds but UI does not open


MACOS
-----

- generate-vst-bundles.sh expects hardcoded directory bin/
- generate-vst-bundles.sh deletes all existing .vst folders, it is not safe to
  run it on a plugin basis. DPF only calls it from the main Makefile after all
  examples have been built.


WINDOWS
-------

- WINWASMBUG : WASM plugins crash on Carla and Live, work as expected on REAPER,
  Renoise and Ardour 7. See WasmEngine.cpp
