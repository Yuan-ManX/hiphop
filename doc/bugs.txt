- LXDRAGDROPBUG : Drag and drop not working on both WKGTK and CEF web views.

- WKGTKRESIZEBUG : Broken CSS viewport units (vw/vh/vmin/vmax) in WebKitGTK web
  view due to workaround for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229227

- WINWASMERBUG : Wasm plugins crash on Carla and Live when running the Wasmer
