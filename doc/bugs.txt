ALL PLATFORMS
-------------

- HTTP server port not reused when running as VST3. As of March '22 DPF state
  support is incomplete/untested for VST3.


LINUX
-----

- Drag and drop not working on both WKGTK and CEF web views.

- Broken CSS viewport units (vw/vh/vmin/vmax) on WebKitGTK web view due to
  workaround for https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229227

- window.devicePixelRatio reports fixed value 1.0 on WebKitGTK web view.


MACOS
-----

- VST3 plugins fail to load on Ableton Live, work as expected on REAPER.
